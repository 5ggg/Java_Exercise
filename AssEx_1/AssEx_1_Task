            Write a method called multiples that prints out all multiples of some integer m between m and
            another intger max in individual lines.
            For example multiples(3,11) should print:
            3

            Write a method called check that takes an integer as an argument and 
            returns a boolean value that is true if the integer is greater
            than 5 and less than 10. Call the method three times with the integers

            Write a method called calculator that prompts the user to input 
            an integer, an operator ('+' or '-') and finally another integer.
            The method should then perform the calculation and print the answer using
            String.format. The result of the claculation should be padded with 
            zeros to make it length 4. E.g. if the user enters:
            4
            -
            3
            The program should output:
            "Calculation: 4 - 3 = 0001"
            The inputs should be on separate lines.
            You don't need to do any error checking on the user input.

        calculator();

        /* Task 5 
            Write a method called table that takes two integers as arguments that correspond to
            a number of rows and a number of columns respectively.
            If either integer is <0 or >= 10, the program should print:
            "Error, rows and columns must be >0 and <10"
            and return.
            If the number of rows and columns is between >=0 and <=9 the method
            should print a table with the table co-ordinates in each position. For example, if
            the number of rows is 2 and the number of columns 4:
              (0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)  (0,3)
              (1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)  (1,3)
            Important:
             - You *must* only use System.out.print and *not* System.out.println...
             - Separate each co-ordinate pair with a tab ('\t')
             - You may *not* use for loops! I.e. you *must* use a do or a while loop.
